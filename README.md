# Welcome to use GOES  
    GOES is a pipeline developed to identify group-specific sequences between two groups of high throughput sequencing samples with long k-mer (generally k=30-40) features. The group-specific here means being present or rich in one group but absent or scarce in another group. GOES is taxonomy-free and only on the frequency of k-mers.
