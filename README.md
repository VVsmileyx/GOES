# Welcome to use GOES  
   GOES is a pipeline developed to identify group-specific sequences between two groups of high throughput sequencing samples with long k-mer (generally k=30-40) features. The group-specific here means being present or rich in one group but absent or scarce in another group. GOES is taxonomy-free and only on the frequency of k-mers  
     
     GOES was developed with Python and implemented on Apache Spark under Unix and Linux platform.  Apache Spark is a high-performance computing architecture to run on HDFS of Hadoop or on a stand-alone multi-core computer in parallel.
